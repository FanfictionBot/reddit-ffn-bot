#Fanfiction Data Bot for Reddit

#**APPROVAL**
Guys, I can confirm this. To start developing this, though, I need manual upvotes, otherwise Reddit's API never lets bots through the CAPTCHA.

It's been a really long time since I've developed in Python, so it will take some time to develop, and iron out bugs.

#**THE GOAL**

Lately, I've seen everyone likes to link fics. Though, that can be tedious, especially if you are on mobile. You have to *go* to fanfiction.net, and then you have to *copy* the link, *hyperlink* it, and then *format* the description. This bot aims to simplify it all - all you'll have to type is

    linkffn(Dagger and Rose)

to link Dagger and Rose.

#**OUTPUT**
Output for

    linkffn(Magics of the Arcane)

will look like this:
> [**Magics of the Arcane** by Eilyfe](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane)
> > *Sometimes, all it takes for a man to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Amid giants, there is no choice but become one yourself. If you want to keep on living, that is. [GoF, Mentor!Albus]*

#**FUTURE UPDATES**
Once I have the basics outlined, I'll start adding in more providers, such as AO3 and DLP. For these, the commands will be

    linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement)

or

    linkdlp(Santi Boy Who Lived)
